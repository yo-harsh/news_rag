The project mainly focus on custom chatbot whcih provide personalized news to user.

- In this project i have used Django for creating a NEWS APP.
- NEWS APP takes news link and huggingface token for using inference API at huggingface endpoint.
- Project uses a scraper, faiss db, and langchain for completing the task.
- Embeddings and llm are both open source (i have also used another llm for testing purpose).
- API was made with docker and developed using AWS EC2 but later then i stoped the service.
